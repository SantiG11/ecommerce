Sneakercs Ecommerce site

This project will consist on recreate the ecommerce design proposed in the frontend mentor site.
My goal is to complete it using React to build it as accurate as possilbe.

The approach I'm going to take for this project is more practical, to test and improve my skills, and to learn while I work. For this purpose I will be more time coding than planning and thinking for the best way to complete each task on the go.
